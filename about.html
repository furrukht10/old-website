        <p> Hi! My name is Furrukh Tanveer. I am a first year student attending Ryerson University pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. The field of Computer Science has always interested me as a child. I was always curious in learning about why a particular device functions the way it does, and what has to be done in order for that device to perform such way. Programming allows me to use my creativity and passion for technology to create new programs and expand my knowledge.  </p>
        <p> Besides technology, I am an individual that has a high passion for sports. As a varsity athlete myself, I enjoy watching, analyzing, and playing sports such as Soccer and BasketBall. Along with that, cycling and exploring nature is something I thoroughly enjoy. During my free time, I like to either create personal projects such as websites, study more to further enhance my understanding of a particular subject, or like many others, enjoy my leisure time with some PC gaming!</p>
